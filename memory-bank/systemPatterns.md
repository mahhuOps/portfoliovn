# System Patterns

**System Architecture:**

*   The project is built with Next.js, a React framework for building web applications.
*   Firebase is used for authentication and data storage.
*   The application utilizes a component-based architecture.

**Key Technical Decisions:**

*   Using Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
*   Using Firebase for authentication and data storage.
*   Using Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Design Patterns:**

*   Component-based architecture
*   Server-side rendering
*   API routes

**Component Relationships:**

*   The `app/layout.tsx` file defines the root layout of the application.
*   The `app/page.tsx` file defines the home page of the application.
*   The `components` directory contains reusable UI components.
